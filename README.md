# Angular-translation-parsing
Python script for reading html files in an Angular project and replacing them

#### Notes:
This script was made to change i18n translation attributes used by Angular, 
but could be used for any kind of parsing of local html files.

The script was done somewhat quickly and some parts are relying on static content which could be changed into using regular expressions with the caveat of making the script more complex (There are alot of edge cases).
